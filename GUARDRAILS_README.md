# Discord RAG Bot - Guardrails System

## Overview

This Discord RAG bot now includes a comprehensive guardrails system designed to prevent hallucinations, improve response quality, and ensure reliable information delivery. The system monitors and validates all responses before they are sent to users.

## Features

###  Anti-Hallucination Protection
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies common hallucination patterns in AI responses
- **Context Grounding**: Ensures responses are based on provided source documents
- **Confidence Scoring**: Rates response confidence from 0.0 to 1.0
- **Source Attribution**: Encourages proper citation of source material

###  Response Quality Monitoring
- **Quality Levels**: High, Medium, Low confidence, and Hallucination Risk
- **Real-time Validation**: Every response is validated before sending
- **Warning System**: Alerts for potential issues
- **Suggestion Engine**: Provides improvement recommendations

###  Content Filtering
- **Inappropriate Content Detection**: Filters out harmful or inappropriate responses
- **Off-topic Response Detection**: Ensures responses stay relevant to questions
- **Length Validation**: Monitors response length for optimal user experience

###  Statistics & Monitoring
- **Admin Dashboard**: View bot performance statistics via `/botstats` command
- **Quality Metrics**: Track response quality over time
- **Guardrail Violations**: Monitor warning frequency
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of all interactions

## How It Works

### 1. Response Generation
When a user asks a question:
1. The RAG system retrieves relevant documents
2. The LLM generates a response based on the context
3. The response is passed through the guardrails system

### 2. Guardrail Validation
The guardrails system performs multiple checks:
- **Hallucination Detection**: Scans for patterns that indicate made-up information
- **Context Grounding**: Verifies the response is based on provided sources
- **Confidence Assessment**: Calculates how confident the response should be
- **Content Filtering**: Checks for inappropriate or off-topic content

### 3. Response Enhancement
Based on validation results:
- **High Confidence**: Response sent as-is
- **Medium Confidence**: Response sent with minor disclaimers
- **Low Confidence**: Response sent with uncertainty warnings
- **Hallucination Risk**: Response sent with strong disclaimers

## Quality Levels

###  High Confidence
- Response is well-grounded in source material
- Uses proper source attribution
- No hallucination patterns detected
- High source coverage

###  Medium Confidence
- Response is mostly grounded in sources
- Some uncertainty markers present
- Minor hallucination risk
- Moderate source coverage

###  Low Confidence
- Response has limited grounding
- Multiple uncertainty markers
- Higher hallucination risk
- Low source coverage

###  Hallucination Risk
- Response contains hallucination patterns
- Poor grounding in source material
- Overly confident language without attribution
- Very low source coverage

## Commands

### `/ask <question>`
Ask a question to the RAG bot. All responses are automatically validated through the guardrails system.

### `/botstats` (Admin Only)
View comprehensive statistics about bot performance and guardrail monitoring.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key  # For rag.py
```

### Logging
The system creates detailed logs in `bot.log` including:
- Query processing information
- Guardrail validation results
- Warning and error messages
- Performance statistics

## Customization

### Adjusting Confidence Thresholds
You can modify the confidence scoring in `guardrails.py`:

```python
def _calculate_confidence_score(self, response: str, context: str) -> float:
    score = 0.5  # Base score
    # Add your custom scoring logic here
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, score))
```

### Adding New Hallucination Patterns
Add patterns to detect in `guardrails.py`:

```python
self.hallucination_patterns = [
    r'\b(your_pattern_here)\b',
    # ... existing patterns
]
```

### Customizing Response Enhancement
Modify the `create_safe_response` function in `guardrails.py` to customize how responses are enhanced based on quality levels.

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Statistics Tracked
- Total queries processed
- Response quality distribution
- Hallucination risk frequency
- Guardrail warning count
- Average confidence scores

### Logging Levels
- **INFO**: Normal operation, query processing
- **WARNING**: Guardrail violations, quality issues
- **ERROR**: System errors, processing failures

## Best Practices

### For Administrators
1. Monitor `/botstats` regularly to track bot performance
2. Review logs for patterns in guardrail violations
3. Update source documents regularly for better context
4. Adjust confidence thresholds based on your needs

### For Users
1. Ask specific, well-formed questions
2. Be aware that responses with warnings may need verification
3. Look for source attributions in responses
4. Report any clearly incorrect information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**High Hallucination Risk Rate**
- Check if source documents are comprehensive
- Verify document quality and relevance
- Consider adjusting confidence thresholds

**Low Response Quality**
- Ensure documents are properly indexed
- Check if questions are specific enough
- Review source document coverage

**Guardrail Warnings**
- Normal for complex or ambiguous questions
- Indicates the system is working to prevent hallucinations
- Review warnings to understand potential issues

## Technical Details

### Architecture
```
User Query → RAG System → LLM Response → Guardrails Validation → Enhanced Response → User
```

### Key Components
- **HallucinationDetector**: Identifies potential hallucinations
- **ResponseValidator**: Validates response quality and appropriateness
- **GuardrailSystem**: Coordinates all validation
- **GuardedRAGBot**: Wraps RAG functionality with guardrails

### Performance Impact
- Minimal latency increase (~100-200ms per query)
- Comprehensive logging for monitoring
- Memory efficient validation algorithms

## Support

For issues or questions about the guardrails system:
1. Check the logs in `bot.log`
2. Review the statistics via `/botstats`
3. Examine the guardrail validation results
4. Consider adjusting configuration parameters

The guardrails system is designed to be robust and self-monitoring, providing clear feedback about its operation and effectiveness.
